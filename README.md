- 💪Hi, I’m Jose Guzman. I am currently pursuin my degree in Computer Science.
- 🫦Some languages i've learned are HTML and Java.
- 🦍Outside of coding I enjoy playing instruments, videogames, and working out. My favorite instrument to play is the Tenor Saxophone, but I also know how to play the clarinet, alto saxophone, and the marimba.
  VideoGames is a hobby of mine. I enjoy videogames because I feel like it helps spark creativity and it's just a fun overall experience. I try to workout at least 3 times a week. I enjoy working out because it 
  helps me maintain a healthy mentality, helps with stress, and it helps with discipline.
- ✈️Another interesting thing about me is that I enjoy traveling. I frequently travel to Mexico to visit family and also explore new places. The vacation I have cherished the most is when I visited Italy. It was something unreal and an experience I've never had before.
